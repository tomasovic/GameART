# GameART JavaScript Coding Task

## Task Description

Please submit the task written in JavaScript.

### Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Challenge accepted! ü§ì Yeet & Sweet! ü§ô
- Task 1: Just to clarify, while I've used some of the methods requested in this challenge in unconventional ways, I
  thought it
  would be both fun and interesting to do so. üòÅ
- Task 2: I tried to implement "somewhat" MVC architecture, regardless of the fact that it's a simple API. No DB.

## Map, Filter, Reduce - Task 1
